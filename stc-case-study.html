      <h4>The Brief:</h4>

      <p>Our UX/UI Bootcamp asked a team of us to redesign a local non-profit website.
        My group selected the Sea Turtle Conservancy because we all love animals and reside in Florida.</p>

      <p>The original website had a lot of amazing opportunities but needed less text, more turtles.</p>

      <p>We had three weeks to build a responsive design prototype for desktop and mobile.</p>

    <div class="col">
      <h4>User Research</h4>

      <p>
        Extensive User Research was performed. Four User Interviews were conducted along with a survey that gave
        us data about how people might engage with this type of a website.</p>

      <p>We found that people wanted lots of options on how to engage and a more inspiring design that was less
        text heavy.</p>

      <p>Some people have extra time and not money, and others extra money and not time. Users felt the cause was
        important and would be involved if there was a simple way to do so.</p>

      <p>User Research was conducted following the interviews and survey. We did an affinity diagram with
        categorization and pain points, user persona, storyboard, value proposition, and user journey map.</p>

      <p>We performed a new card sort and feature prioritization matrix to help us focus on specific tasks in our
        three week timeframe.</p>

      <p>We then moved on and did analysis and formed high level goals. As well as refreshing the website and
        making it more engaging, we wanted to clarify the calls to action and add a third: educate/learn.

          <h4>The Problem</h4>

          <p>Sea Turtles are Endangered and it’s difficult to know how to help. People are not always sure how to get
            involved and websites do not always offer clear, realistic actions.</p>


          <h4 class="text-end">The Solution</h4>

          <p class="text-end">We believe that a beautifully designed website about Saving the Sea Turtles with clear calls to action
            will give people a cause to become involved in! Make it easy to Save the Sea Turtles!</p>

    <div class="col">
      <h4>Design Choices</h4>

      <p>We then moved on to our moodboard and design choices. We wanted rouded edges in both the fonts and text
        bubbles to mimic the ocean and turtle shapes. We went with a bold, fun color palette featuring teals and
        a pop of coral. We used a turtle design as the home button for our mobile prototype. </p>

      <h4>Prototyping & User Testing</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Paper sketches were made for the website design
        </li>
        <li>Four different versions were built for both desktop and mobile
        </li>
        <li>User testing was performed following each version, notes taken, and analysis performed.
        </li>
        <li>A new iteration was then made based on the user tests.
        </li>
        <li>Key user testing takeaways: users wanted to adopt a turtle (we built this feature out in both
          desktop and mobile), users wanted to be able to trust the site in order to donate (so we changed
          the header font), users wanted to select the turtle during the adoption process (we added this),
          users wanted a logo added to the mobile version, and users wanted to have the mission even
          further clarified on the homepage (we accomplished this with some animated exposition).
        </li>

      <h4>Did we accomplish our goals?</h4>
      <p>
        We feel that we did! Users thought the final version was:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Engaging, playful and fun with a cohesive design</li>
        <li>They were able to find ways to Save the Sea Turtles (such as adopting)</li>
        <li>Vibrant with a lot of photos and media</li>

      <h4>Future Steps:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Add an “Advocate” Button and Section as a fourth call to action to make it easier to share on social
          media and engage more
        </li>
        <li>Build out the pages to create even more functionality
          Focus on building out the turtle tracking, volunteering, and experiences user paths and pages
        </li>
        <li>Feature the various programs available
        </li>
        <li>Add more media such as videos and interesting facts to further engage users
        </li>
        <li>Add a log in feature so that users can feel more comfortable with purchasing, donating, etc.</li>
